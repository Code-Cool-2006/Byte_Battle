    Smart Classroom Management Software (SCMS): Enhancing Learning with Automation, Analytics, and Engagement 
    
-> Objective of the Problem Statement 
    To design and build a comprehensive digital platform that streamlines classroom operations using 
    automation, real-time analytics, and AI-driven engagement tools. The solution should reduce manual 
    overhead, improve safety and resource efficiency, and enhance the learning experience through 
    smart feedback, personalized support, and seamless administrative workflows. 
    The system should enable teachers, students, and administrators to operate in sync through a 
    centralized platform, making classroom management intelligent, responsive, and impactful.
    
-> Core Requirements

  1.) Attendance Automation 
    • Facial recognition-based attendance via CCTV/smart camera integration OR mobile-based QR/GPS check-in. 
    • Real-time attendance dashboard for each class. 
    • Auto-generation of attendance reports (daily, weekly, monthly) accessible by staff and admin. 
    • Alert for irregular attendance or prolonged absenteeism.
    
  2.) Resource and Infrastructure Management 
    • Smart scheduling and booking system for classroom resources (projectors, labs, tablets, boards). 
    • Real-time status of resource availability. 
    • Predictive maintenance alerts and automatic logging of issues. 
    • Admin interface to add/remove/update classroom assets.

  3.) Safety and Security System 
    • Emergency alert system integration with fire alarms, cameras, or panic buttons. 
    • Real-time notifications to teachers, school safety officers, and local authorities. 
    • Automated lockdown/evacuation protocols and live status dashboards. 
    • Audit logs of security breaches or safety events.

  4.) 🧑‍🏫 Interactive Learning Tools Integration 
    • Plug-and-play support for smartboards and digital displays. 
    • AI-based content adaptation based on student understanding. 
    • Real-time quizzes, polls, and learning engagement metrics. 
    • Dashboard for teachers showing student interaction level per session.

  5.) Analytics and Reporting System 
    • Collect and visualize data on: 
    • Attendance patterns 
    • Student participation 
    • Resource usage 
    • Incident reports 
    • Predictive analytics for identifying students at risk (low participation, poor attendance). 
    • Weekly/monthly visual reports for teachers, students, and management.
    
  6.) AI-powered Learning Assistant (Chatbot) 
    • Integrated chatbot available on web/app to: 
    o Explain unclear concepts to students 
    o Recommend personalized learning material 
    o Track progress and identify learning gaps 
    o Allow anonymous questions during class sessions
    
  7.)💬 Forum & Collaboration Hub 
    • Sectioned forums with access control: 
    o Student-only discussions 
    o Teacher-to-teacher collaboration 
    o Admin announcements 
    o Student-teacher Q&A with moderation tools 
    • Notifications and tagging system for important threads.

-> Suggested Tech Stack 
    Frontend: 
      • HTML / CSS / JS / React.js  
      • Real-time updates via WebSockets or Firebase
    Backend: 
      • Node.js with Express 
      • PostgreSQL for relational data (attendance, resources) 
      • MongoDB for unstructured data (logs, discussions) 
      • Redis for session & alert caching 
      • Python OpenCV + dlib or AWS Rekognition for facial recognition
    AI/ML: 
      • TensorFlow or PyTorch (for facial recognition & chatbot) 
      • OpenAI GPT (or fine-tuned LLM) for personalized chatbot
